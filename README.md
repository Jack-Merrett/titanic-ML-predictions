# Titanic Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the code and resources for my Titanic machine learning project. The goal of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset and build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not. The dataset is obtained from the Kaggle competition: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset consists of various features such as passenger class, age, gender, fare, etc., along with a binary target variable "Survived" indicating whether the passenger survived or not. The dataset is split into two parts: a training set with labeled data and a test set without labels. The model will be trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the Titanic dataset in CSV format, with separate files for the training and test sets.

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks are provided to perform data exploration, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

- `src/`: This directory contains the Python scripts used for data preprocessing and model building. The main script `train_model.py` loads the data, preprocesses it, trains the machine learning model, and saves the trained model to a file.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python libraries required to run the code. You can set up the environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-machine-learning.git
cd titanic-machine-learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
